# OIE Web Client

A web-based administrator for **[Open Integration Engine](https://github.com/openintegrationengine)** (OIE / Mirth Connect) — a browser
replacement for the Swing Administrator client. Run it as a standalone Node.js
app, use the published Docker image, or deploy its optional WAR directly into an
existing OIE server. It talks to the engine over the REST API and is **pluggable**: extension
developers add features by dropping a folder into `plugins/` (the web equivalent
of the engine's `plugin.xml` extension model).

Both administrators can be used side by side against the same engine — this app
is read/write through the same `/api` surface the Swing client uses. An optional
**[Web Support plugin](#requirements)** adds message-tree serialization,
engine-side JavaScript validation, engine-served plugin UIs, and an embedded WAR;
the rest of the administrator continues to work without it.

## Repository layout

An npm-workspaces monorepo: the application plus the `@oie/*` framework packages
plugin authors build against.

## Requirements

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Node.js** | **22.18+; tested on 22.22.3** | Use the pinned `.nvmrc` for source builds, tests and the packaged Node runtime. |
| **npm** | Bundled with Node 22 | Run `npm ci` at the repository root; this is an npm-**workspaces** monorepo. Yarn/pnpm are not used. |
| **JDK** | **17+** (WAR builds only) | Supplies the standard `jar` tool used by `npm run build:war`; it is not needed to run the Node/Docker deployment. |
| **OIE / Mirth Connect engine** | **4.6.0** | The app is a *client* to a **running** engine — it neither bundles nor starts one. Default `https://127.0.0.1:8443`. This release line targets OIE 4.6.0. |
| **OIE Web Support plugin** | available separately | **Optional for the base administrator; required only for** byte-exact message-tree serialization, engine-side JavaScript validation, engine-served plugin UIs, and the plugin-managed embedded WAR. Download it and read its installation notes at **[gibson9583/oie-web-support-plugin](https://github.com/gibson9583/oie-web-support-plugin)**. |
| **Modern browser** | current Chrome / Edge / Firefox / Safari | ES-module SPA; the Monaco script editor is bundled and served locally (works air-gapped), with a plain-editor fallback. |

Contributors running the end-to-end tests also install Playwright's browsers:
`npx playwright install chromium firefox webkit`.

## Quick start from source

> **Optional Web Support plugin.** The base administrator can be started without
> Web Support. Install the plugin from
> **[gibson9583/oie-web-support-plugin](https://github.com/gibson9583/oie-web-support-plugin)**
> when you need message trees, engine-side Validate Script, engine-served plugin
> UIs, or plugin-managed WAR installation.

> ⚠️ Run `npm install` **at the repository root**. This is an npm-workspaces
> monorepo — installing inside `web-administrator/` will not link the `@oie/*`
> packages and the app won't start.

```bash
# 1) From the repo root — installs every workspace (root, packages/*, web-administrator):
npm install

# 2) Point the app at your engine:
cd web-administrator
cp config.example.json config.json        # then edit "engine.url" to your OIE/Mirth REST URL

# 3) Run it:
npm run dev                               # dev: file-watch + Vite, no build step (recommended while developing)
#   — or —
npm run build && npm start                # optimized production build + server

# Open http://localhost:3030 and sign in with your engine credentials.
```

The engine must be **running and reachable** at `engine.url` before you sign in.
Engine certificate verification is enabled by default. For a private CA or
self-signed engine, trust its PEM certificate with
[`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/path/to/engine-ca.pem`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#node_extra_ca_certsfile)
when starting Node, and use an engine URL matching the certificate's hostname.
Mount the PEM and set the same variable in Docker. `OIE_VERIFY_TLS=false` is an
explicit opt-out for isolated local development only.

`npm run dev` serves and transforms `client/` source on the fly — no manual build
while developing. `npm run build` emits the optimized `client/dist` required by
`npm start`; the unbuilt TypeScript/Tailwind source cannot boot in a browser
without Vite. Either supported path keeps the framework a single shared instance,
so runtime-loaded plugins resolve against the same copy.

## Deploy into an existing OIE server (WAR)

The WAR is the smallest production deployment: OIE's embedded Jetty already
loads every `*.war` in its `webapps/` directory, so no Node process, reverse
proxy, or extra port is required.

Download `websupport-<version>.zip` from the
[Web Support releases](https://github.com/gibson9583/oie-web-support-plugin/releases),
install it through the Swing Administrator, and restart OIE. The plugin installs
both the additional APIs and its embedded `oie-webadmin.war`.

To build and copy the WAR yourself instead:

```bash
# From the repository root (after npm install):
npm run build:war

# Stop OIE, copy the artifact, then start OIE again:
cp web-administrator/dist/oie-webadmin.war /path/to/OIE/webapps/
```

Open `https://<oie-host>:8443/oie-webadmin/`. OIE derives the URL context from
the filename, so renaming the artifact to `admin.war` deploys it at `/admin/`.
The generated JSP discovers both that name and a non-root OIE
`http.contextpath` at runtime; the WAR does not bake in a server URL. Use the
HTTPS listener—the engine API is HTTPS-only unless `server.api.allowhttp` is
explicitly enabled.

WAR mode is intentionally tied to the OIE server hosting it. Local login/MFA,
engine extension install/uninstall, and bundled plugins work directly against
that server; engine-served plugin UIs additionally require native web-support
endpoints or the Web Support extension. Features that need the Node server—multiple
engine targets, a user-entered engine URL, `pluginDirs`, and Node-managed TLS—
remain available through the source or Docker modes.

The Web Support package installs its embedded WAR. You can still run
the Node.js or Docker deployment instead; the embedded copy simply remains
available at `/oie-webadmin/`.

## Run with Docker

Prebuilt images are published to Docker Hub as
[`gibson9583/oie-web-client`](https://hub.docker.com/r/gibson9583/oie-web-client):
`latest` is the latest release, `X.Y.Z` / `X.Y` pin specific releases, `main`
is a rolling build of the `main` branch tip, and `pr-N` previews open pull
requests (removed when the PR closes).

```bash
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:3030:3030 \
  -e OIE_URL=https://host.docker.internal:8443 \
  gibson9583/oie-web-client:latest
```

Inside a container `localhost` is the container itself — use
`host.docker.internal` to reach an engine running on the Docker host (Docker
Desktop), or the engine's real hostname otherwise.

The image bakes in **no configuration** — it reads the same settings as a source
install (see [Node/Docker configuration](#nodedocker-configuration)). Env vars cover the per-setting
overrides; for the full config document — `allowedUrls`, `tls`, `pluginDirs`,
plugin settings — mount a file or pass the JSON inline:

```bash
# Mount a config document (reference any PEMs by absolute path):
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:3030:3030 \
  -v ./my-config:/config:ro -e WEBADMIN_CONFIG=/config/config.json \
  gibson9583/oie-web-client:latest

# …or inject the document itself (e.g. from an orchestrator secret):
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:3030:3030 \
  -e WEBADMIN_CONFIG_JSON='{"allowedUrls":[{"name":"Prod","url":"https://oie-prod:8443"}]}' \
  gibson9583/oie-web-client:latest
```

The examples publish plain HTTP on host loopback only. The container runs as the
non-root `node` user and listens on `3030`; for routable access, terminate TLS in
front or configure [built-in TLS](#serving-over-https) with mounted PEMs before
publishing a non-loopback host address. When enabling built-in TLS in Docker,
replace the image's default plain-HTTP healthcheck with an HTTPS-aware probe.
Build the image yourself with `docker build -t oie-web-client .` from the repo
root.

## Node/Docker configuration

Settings load from a single JSON **config document**, then per-setting
environment-variable overrides on top. The document comes from the first of
(highest wins): `WEBADMIN_CONFIG_JSON` (the JSON itself, inline), the file named
by `WEBADMIN_CONFIG` (mountable anywhere in a container), or
`web-administrator/config.json` (gitignored — it holds machine-specific paths).
An explicitly named source that is missing or unparseable fails startup rather
than silently booting on defaults. Start from
[`config.example.json`](web-administrator/config.example.json):

| Setting | Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `port` | `WEBADMIN_PORT` | `3030` | Port the web UI listens on |
| `host` | `WEBADMIN_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address (Docker explicitly binds all container interfaces) |
| `engine.url` | `OIE_URL` | `https://127.0.0.1:8443` | Engine base URL |
| `engine.verifyTls` | `OIE_VERIFY_TLS` | `true` | Verify the engine's TLS certificate |
| `allowedUrls` | — | `[]` | Multi-engine mode: `[{ "name", "url", "verifyTls"? }, …]` becomes an engine picker on the login screen. Empty → single-engine mode (just `engine.url`, no picker) |
| `devMode` | `WEBADMIN_DEV_MODE` | `false` | Adds a free-form engine URL field at login. The proxy forwards to whatever is typed, so trusted/dev deployments only. (Distinct from `npm run dev`, which is the Vite dev server) |
| `pluginDirs` | `WEBADMIN_PLUGIN_DIRS` | `[]` | Additional **local** plugin dirs scanned alongside the bundled `./plugins` (e.g. for local development). Extensions installed on the engine are served by the engine, not stored here. The env var uses the platform path-list delimiter (`:` on Unix, `;` on Windows) |
| `trustedProxies` | `WEBADMIN_TRUSTED_PROXIES` | `[]` | Peer IPs trusted to set `X-Forwarded-For` (a front TLS terminator / reverse proxy). Loopback is always trusted. Comma-separated in the env var |
| `codeTemplateCompletions` | `WEBADMIN_CODE_TEMPLATE_COMPLETIONS` | `true` | Offer the channel's own code-template functions as script-editor autocompletions; disable to avoid fetching very large catalogs |
| `tls` | `WEBADMIN_TLS_KEY` / `WEBADMIN_TLS_CERT` / `WEBADMIN_TLS_PASSPHRASE` | `null` (HTTP) | Serve the UI over **HTTPS** directly — set `{ "key", "cert", "passphrase"? }` to PEM file paths (both key and cert required). Off by default; see [Serving over HTTPS](#serving-over-https) |

### OpenID Connect sign-in

SSO is configured entirely on the engine, under **Settings → OIDC
Authentication** (the `oie-oidc-auth` extension): discovery URL, client ID and
secret, the web administrator's own URL, provisioning, and role mapping. This
server keeps nothing — no provider entry, no secret — and the login card asks the
engine whether it offers SSO. The extension's README carries the provider
recipes.

### Engine routing modes

- **Single engine** (default): set `engine.url`; every login goes to that engine.
- **Multiple engines**: list them in `allowedUrls` — the login screen shows a
  picker and the proxy routes each session to the engine chosen at login:

  ```json
  {
      "allowedUrls": [
          { "name": "Production", "url": "https://oie-prod:8443", "verifyTls": true },
          { "name": "Test", "url": "https://oie-test:8443" }
      ]
  }
  ```

- **Open engine URL** (`devMode: true`): the login screen accepts any engine URL
  typed by the user. The proxy will forward to whatever host is entered — use
  only on trusted networks / developer machines.

How `engine` and `allowedUrls` relate: a non-empty `allowedUrls` **replaces**
the engine list — `engine.url` is not added to the picker automatically, so
include it as an entry if it should be selectable. `engine.verifyTls` remains
the fallback for any entry that omits its own `verifyTls`. The `OIE_URL` /
`OIE_VERIFY_TLS` env vars override only `engine`, never `allowedUrls`.

An engine's **name is its identity**: a user's remembered login choice is keyed
to the name, not the entry's position, so entries can be added, removed, or
reordered freely without repointing anyone's saved selection. Names must
therefore be distinct (startup fails on a collision), and renaming or removing
an engine invalidates saved selections for it — those users are asked to choose
an engine at their next sign-in rather than being routed to a fallback.
Upgrading from a version that remembered the choice by list position invalidates
remembered selections once: each user re-picks their engine at the next sign-in.

> **Authentication** is the engine's own: the login form posts to
> `/api/users/_login` and the engine's `JSESSIONID` cookie carries the session.
> The Node server stores no credentials; it is a streaming reverse proxy.

Node/Docker scopes upstream cookie names to each engine URL. Upgrading from
unscoped cookies requires signing in again. API calls carry the tab's selected
engine and login generation; a change in another tab reloads stale views before
they can submit old data. Plugin code should use `platform.api` / `@oie/web-api`
so it participates in this check. Authenticated proxy mutations without the
context header are refused. WAR cookies remain owned by the hosting engine.

Channel working copies are kept only in memory. Session expiry, inactivity
logout, and sign-out discard unsaved channel edits; there is no automatic draft
recovery after signing back in. Startup removes drafts saved by older versions
from browser storage for every engine/account, because they may contain credentials.

Engine requests use `cache: 'no-store'` in both Node and WAR deployments.
The client makes a separate background request with [`Clear-Site-Data: "cache"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Clear-Site-Data)
to evict HTTP responses retained by older clients. Successful completion is recorded
per browser and application path; interrupted or failed cleanup retries on the next
page load. Keeping this header off the document avoids blocking navigation on
Chromium's cache deletion. Legacy cleanup also clears cached static
assets for the origin; it preserves cookies and preferences. For an upgrade on a
browser without support for this header, clear that site's cached files manually.
The header requires a secure context, so remote deployments must use HTTPS.

### Serving over HTTPS

By default the source app serves HTTP on **loopback only** (`127.0.0.1:3030`).
Keep Docker's published port on host loopback as shown above. For remote access,
configure HTTPS before binding to a network interface (`WEBADMIN_HOST`). Two
ways to encrypt the browser connection:

- **Reverse proxy (recommended for production).** Terminate TLS at nginx, Caddy,
  Traefik, or a load balancer in front of the app — you get automatic certificate
  issuance/renewal, HTTP→HTTPS redirect, and HSTS for free. Set `trustedProxies` to
  the proxy's IP so the engine's audit log sees the real client address. With Caddy
  it's essentially `your.host { reverse_proxy localhost:3030 }`.

- **Built-in TLS (handy for standalone installs).** Point the app at a PEM key +
  cert and it serves HTTPS itself — no extra process:

  ```json
  {
      "tls": { "key": "certs/webadmin-key.pem", "cert": "certs/webadmin-cert.pem" }
  }
  ```

  or via env: `WEBADMIN_TLS_KEY` / `WEBADMIN_TLS_CERT` (+ `WEBADMIN_TLS_PASSPHRASE`
  if the key is encrypted). Paths are relative to `web-administrator/` or absolute;
  **both key and cert are required**; incomplete TLS configuration stops startup. Startup logs `https://…  (TLS)`.
  A self-signed cert works for testing (browsers will warn); use a CA-issued cert
  in production.

Byte-exact message-tree serialization and JavaScript validation come from the
**connected engine** (`/datatypes/_serialize`, `/javascript/_validate`) — no
local JVM or engine install to configure. The client probes for these on each
session: engine-native endpoints first, then the **Web Support plugin**
([oie-web-support-plugin](https://github.com/gibson9583/oie-web-support-plugin)),
which provides them on a stock engine with no engine changes. With neither,
the app still works — message trees, server-side validation, and engine-served
plugin UIs are disabled with a notice. Format Document runs entirely client-side.

## Troubleshooting setup

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Cannot find package '@oie/web-api'`, a blank page, or bare-import errors | You installed inside a subfolder. Remove `node_modules` and run `npm install` from the **repo root** — workspaces hoist there. |
| Login fails, "engine unreachable", or a `502` | The engine isn't running or `engine.url` is wrong. Confirm `<engine.url>/api/server/version` responds. |
| TLS / certificate errors reaching the engine | Trust the engine CA with `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` at startup and check the URL matches its certificate hostname. |
| `EADDRINUSE` / port `3030` already in use | Set `WEBADMIN_PORT` (or `port` in `config.json`). |
| Vite or syntax errors on `npm run dev` / `npm start` | Use Node 22.22.3 from `.nvmrc` (`node -v`); the minimum is 22.18. |
| WAR URL returns 404 after copying | OIE discovers WARs only at startup. Put the file directly in `<OIE_HOME>/webapps/`, restart OIE, and use the context matching the WAR filename. |
| Message trees, Validate Script, or engine-served plugin UIs don't work | The connected engine has neither native web-support endpoints nor the [Web Support plugin](https://github.com/gibson9583/oie-web-support-plugin). Install the plugin and restart the engine. Format Document remains available because it is client-side. |

## Plugins & the Community Store

Nearly every feature is a plugin — connectors, data types, dashboard tabs,
settings panels, and more — and third parties add their own the same way the
bundled ones are built.

The **[OIE Community Store](https://github.com/gibson9583/oie-community-store)** is
the easiest way to find and install plugins that support the web client. It's a
**web-only** feature: browse community plugins, channels, and code templates and
install them straight from the client UI — no manual file copying. Many existing
community plugins have been updated with web client support and are available there
for testing.

Building your own? See
[`web-administrator/PLUGINS.md`](web-administrator/PLUGINS.md) for the extension
points and worked examples.

## Framework packages (`@oie/*`)

Plugins build against published workspace packages instead of reaching into
shell internals:

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`@oie/web-api`](packages/web-api) | Engine REST client + model helpers |
| [`@oie/web-ui`](packages/web-ui) | DOM toolkit, tables, forms, code editor, connector-panel helpers |
| [`@oie/web-shell`](packages/web-shell) | `platform` extension points (nav, views, settings, connectors) |
| [`@oie/eslint-config`](packages/eslint-config) | Shared lint config enforcing the public-API boundary |

The framework implements API **4.8.0**, with plugin Reference registration
and lookup, scoped editor completions and connector-form callbacks/validation.
See the [API 4.8 contracts](web-administrator/PLUGINS.md#api-48-plugin-contracts)
for signatures and compatibility, including Web Support's datatype vocabulary
manifest declaration.

At runtime the host page's import map resolves `@oie/*` to the shell's loaded
copy, so a plugin shares one framework instance whether it's bundled or served
from an extension zip. Plugins may also import the framework by absolute URL
(`/core/ui.js`); `@oie/*` is preferred for the dev-time types and lint. Run
`npm run lint` at the repo root to enforce the boundary.

## Development

Run from the repo root:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run lint` | ESLint across the repo, including the `@oie/*` import-boundary rules |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc` over six projects — the `@oie/*` public type surface (`type-tests/`), the client, server, plugins, views, and the e2e suite |
| `npm run build:war` | Build the optimized client and package `web-administrator/dist/oie-webadmin.war` for OIE's `webapps/` directory |
| `npm run e2e` | Playwright suite; `/api/*` is mocked in-browser, so it runs with no engine |
| `npm run e2e:live` | The same specs against a real engine (opt-in via `E2E_LIVE=1`) |
| `npm run wiki:screenshots` | Regenerate the Wiki's first-party UI screenshots from deterministic mocked engine data |
| `npm run gen:userapi` | Regenerate `web-administrator/client/core/userapi.generated.js` from the engine `userutil` Java sources/Javadocs (`../oie` by default or `OIE_SRC`) |
| `npm run vendor:zip` | Rebuild the vendored `client/vendor/zipjs.min.js` bundle from `@zip.js/zip.js` |

### Releasing

**Bump the root and `web-administrator/package.json` versions (and the lockfile)
in the same commit you tag.** The web-administrator field is what the app reports
in the About dialog, startup banner, and `/webadmin/config.json`; nothing derives
it from the tag. Keep the monorepo release version synchronized so tooling and
the application identify the same release.

Pushing a `v*` tag also publishes `oie-webadmin.war` as a GitHub Release asset.
The Web Support release pipeline consumes the version declared by its
`webclient.version` build property and records this repository's resolved tag and
the WAR SHA-256 in its own release notes.

Git supplies only the build *metadata* beside it (commit, build date, and a
`dirty` flag when the tree had uncommitted changes), stamped into a gitignored
`build-info.json` by `tools/build-info.mjs` on every build. CI and the Docker
build pass the commit in as a build arg, since `.git` is never in the image
context.

So a release is: bump the versions, commit, tag `vX.Y.Z`, and push the tag. The
Docker workflow cuts `X.Y.Z` / `X.Y` image tags from it and moves `latest` only
for a non-prerelease semantic-version tag; the separate `main` tag tracks the
branch tip.

### Docker tag cleanup

CI publishes `validated-<run-id>-<attempt>-<amd64|arm64>` intermediate tags
before creating the normal multi-platform tags. The
[validated-tag cleanup workflow](.github/workflows/docker-validated-cleanup.yml)
runs daily at 06:23 UTC and removes these intermediate tags after 24 hours,
only when their CI run is confirmed completed in this repository. Active or
unverifiable runs are kept and logged. Release, `latest`, `main`, and `pr-*`
tags are outside its scope; the existing closed-PR workflow handles `pr-*`.
Cleanup removes tag names through Docker Hub, never manifests by digest.

To preview or clear an existing backlog, open **Actions → Clean up validated
Docker tags → Run workflow**. Leave **dry_run** checked to preview; uncheck it
to delete eligible tags. The workflow must be pushed to the default branch
before the daily schedule is active. It uses the existing `DOCKERHUB_IMAGE`
variable and `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` / `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` secrets; the token needs
**Read, Write, Delete** permission. API failures fail the job; rerunning safely
continues after any tags already removed.
