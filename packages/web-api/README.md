# @oie/web-api

The OIE engine REST client and model helpers used by the web administrator and
its plugins. This is the **leaf** package — it has no `@oie/*` dependencies.

```js
import api, { asList, uuid } from '@oie/web-api';

const channels = await api.channels.list();
const stats    = await api.statistics.list();
const ids      = asList(someXStreamMap, 'string');
```

## What's in here

- `api` (default export) — the REST surface, grouped by resource
  (`api.channels`, `api.messages`, `api.users`, `api.server`, …). Every call
  goes through the web admin's reverse proxy, which adds the engine's required
  `X-Requested-With` CSRF header.
- Model/serialization helpers — `asList`, `uuid`, and the XStream
  map/list shaping used to talk to the engine.
- Display helpers — `toDisplayString` and `mappingEntries` render an
  XStream-encoded value the way the Swing client shows it (`{k=v, …}` for a
  map, `[a, b]` for a list, the payload for a scalar).

## Channel tags (API 4.8)

The API provides `api.channels.tags(channelId: string): Promise<ChannelTag[]>`
for the tags assigned to one channel. It reads the channel's XML export using
Channel View permission, so it also works for users without Tags View.
`api.server.channelTags(): Promise<ChannelTag[]>` reads all tags using Tags View.
Both preserve names as exact XML strings, including `-0`, `null` and `1e5`.

Match existing tags by `id`; preserve names, memberships and optional colors
when writing. Read membership lists with `asList(tag.channelIds, 'string')`.
Valid empty collections return `[]`; failed requests or invalid XML reject,
so keep the draft for retry rather than replacing its tags with an empty list.
See [Channel tag helpers](../../web-administrator/PLUGINS.md#channel-tag-helpers)
for the response and failure contracts.

## Runtime model (important for plugin authors)

At runtime inside the web admin, `@oie/web-api` resolves — via the page's
import map — to the **shell's already-loaded** copy (`/core/pkg-api.js`), so
your plugin shares the shell's single API/session instance. The bundled
`dist/` here exists for build-time resolution and standalone use; never assume
a second copy is created at runtime.

The package ships TypeScript declarations **generated from the client's
TypeScript sources** (`index.d.ts` re-exports `types/`, emitted by
`npm run gen:types -w oie-web-administrator`), so the published types are the
same ones the implementation compiles against. Engine model objects come from
the engine's OpenAPI spec: `npm run gen:schema -w @oie/web-api` regenerates the
canonical `web-administrator/client/core/oie-schema.d.ts` and the package-root
copy, and the next `gen:types` copies it into `types/oie-schema.d.ts`. The wire
shapes (`WireChannel`, `XStreamList`, `XStreamElements`, ...) are declared in
`web-administrator/client/core/wire-types.ts` and re-exported here.
