# Web Administrator Plugin Development

The web administrator mirrors the engine's extension philosophy: the Swing
client loads `ClientPlugin` classes declared in `plugin.xml`; the web
administrator loads JavaScript modules declared in `plugin.json`. Built-in
views register through the **same public registries** plugins use, so first- and
third-party extensions use the same supported contracts.

> **Component-based plugin UI is React.** Those extension points are authored
> against the host's own React instance (`platform.React`) and register a
> **`component`**. Full routed views may also use the lower-level imperative view
> handler, and some descriptors are intentionally data-only or callback-only
> (for example data types, transmission modes, and dashboard columns). See
> [Writing plugins in React](#writing-plugins-in-react) for the contract.

## Adding a web UI: three starting points

**A — You already have an engine extension (Java + Swing).** The common case,
and the cheapest. Your plugin's server side already exists as an engine
extension with REST servlets (and a Swing `ClientPlugin` panel). To bring it to
the web administrator you write **only the web UI half** — a React connector
panel, settings tab, or view that calls your *existing* engine endpoints at
`/api/extensions/<path>`. No new server code, no second copy of your logic. The
web UI can **replace** the Swing panel or **run side by side** with it (the
engine doesn't care which administrator a user opens), so you can ship the web
UI incrementally while the Swing client keeps working. The bundled `server-log`,
`datapruner`, `httpauth`, and `mllpmode` plugins — and the third-party SQS
connector and TLS Manager plugins — are all this shape. See
[Pairing with engine-side extensions](#pairing-with-engine-side-extensions) and
[Adding UI for custom engine connectors](#adding-ui-for-custom-engine-connectors).

**B — A brand-new plugin with an engine (Java) backend.** Build the engine
extension from scratch — the connector, servlet, or service that runs **in the
engine** — and pair it with a UI. The UI can be **web** (a React plugin like the
ones here), **Swing** (a classic `ClientPlugin`), or **both** at once: they're
independent clients of the same engine extension, so you can ship one and add
the other later. This is the classic full-plugin shape; everything in **A**
applies the moment the engine half exists. Ship the engine half as a normal
engine extension and the web half as a web admin plugin with the same name —
optionally [bundling the web UI inside the engine extension zip](#shipping-the-web-ui-inside-the-engine-extension)
so a single install delivers both.

**C — Pure web plugin, no Java (`server.js`).** *New.* A plugin can now ship its
own **Node/Express backend** (`server.js`, mounted at `/plugin-api/<id>`) right
inside the web administrator. That means a plugin needing server-side logic no
longer requires an engine (Java) extension at all: a React frontend **plus** a
`server.js` backend is a fully self-contained, **pure-JavaScript plugin** —
something that wasn't possible before, when *any* server-side behaviour meant
authoring and deploying a Java engine extension. Use it for web-only tooling,
talking to other backends, or anything that doesn't belong in the engine. See
[Server side](#server-side).

Most plugins are **A** or **B** (logic that belongs in the engine, reachable by
either administrator). Reach for **C** only when you genuinely need server code
that has no place in the engine.

## Anatomy of a plugin

```
plugins/
└── my-plugin/
    ├── plugin.json          # manifest (required)
    ├── server.js            # optional Node/Express extension
    └── web/
        ├── plugin.tsx       # browser entry — React/TypeScript SOURCE you author
        ├── plugin.js        # COMPILED output (the served entry; what plugin.json points to)
        └── ...              # any other assets, served at /plugins/my-plugin/...
```

You author **`plugin.tsx`** (or `.ts` for a data-only entry); a build step bundles
it to **`plugin.js`** (the served entry). The browser can't run TypeScript or JSX
directly — it loads the compiled `.js`, which is
served raw and dynamically `import()`-ed at runtime (so it shares the one running
framework instance instead of bundling its own). See
[Building the browser entry](#building-the-browser-entry).

`plugin.json`:

```json
{
    "id": "my-plugin",
    "name": "My Plugin",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "author": "You",
    "description": "What it does",
    "enabled": true,
    "oie": { "apiMin": "4.6" },
    "client": { "entry": "web/plugin.js" },
    "server": { "entry": "server.js" }
}
```

`oie.apiMin` (optional) is the **minimum `@oie/*` API version your plugin needs** —
see [API version compatibility](#api-version-compatibility). Omit it and your
plugin always loads (no gate); set it when you rely on a framework capability
added in a specific version, so an older web administrator that lacks it skips
your plugin with a clear message instead of crashing on a missing API.

Engine datatype extensions can also declare `vocabularies` in their
`webadmin/plugin.json` to provide message-tree field names. See
[Datatype vocabulary descriptions](#datatype-vocabulary-descriptions).

Drop the folder into `plugins/` (or any configured `pluginDirs` entry) — with a
built `web/plugin.js` present (see [Building the browser entry](#building-the-browser-entry)) —
and **refresh the browser**. Plugin directories are re-scanned on every load, so
no web administrator restart is needed; the running tab only picks up the change
on refresh (it loads plugins once at boot). The exception is a plugin's optional
`server.js`: new ones mount on first discovery, but *updating* an already-loaded
server entry requires a restart (Node module cache). Load status appears under
**Extensions → Web Administrator Plugins**.

> ⚠️ **Install only trusted plugins.** A plugin runs code in the browser, and an
> optional `server.js` runs code in the web administrator's Node process
> (mounted at `/plugin-api/<id>`, with this server's filesystem and config in
> reach). Treat installing a plugin as running its code — install only from
> sources you trust. This is the same trust model as the Swing client's
> `plugin.xml`/`*Classes` extensions, which load Java into the client/server.
> Note that `pluginDirs` may point at the engine's `extensions/` tree, so an
> installed engine extension carrying a `webadmin/` folder is loaded too.

## How the engine's own extensions are packaged (same as yours)

Every extension in an engine install — including all the "built-in" ones
(`datapruner`, `serverlog`, `dashboardstatus`, the `datatype-*` set, `mllpmode`,
and the connectors themselves) — uses the identical packaging: a folder under
`extensions/` containing `plugin.xml` (and/or `source.xml`/`destination.xml`)
plus its `*-client.jar`/`*-server.jar`/`*-shared.jar` libraries, declaring
`<serverClasses>`, `<clientClasses>`, `<library>` entries (CLIENT/SERVER/SHARED
jars) and optional `apiProvider` REST servlets. In the engine
source they are ordinary packages under `server/src/com/mirth/connect/plugins/`
and `.../connectors/`. Third-party extensions are first-class citizens of the
same mechanism — the SQS connector repo is representative of how the bundled
ones are built.

## Swing extension points → web admin equivalents

| Swing plugin class | Bundled engine example | Web admin equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| `ClientPlugin` (full view + tasks) | Global Map Viewer | `registerNavItem` + `registerView` |
| `DashboardTabPlugin` | `serverlog` (Server Log), `dashboardstatus` (Connection Log) | `registerDashboardTab` — see `plugins/server-log`, `plugins/connection-status` |
| `DashboardColumnPlugin` | `dashboardstatus` (Connection column) | `registerDashboardColumn` — see `plugins/connection-status` |
| `SettingsPanelPlugin` | `datapruner` (Data Pruner tab) | ships as the `datapruner` web plugin calling `registerSettingsPanel` |
| `ChannelTabPlugin` | (commercial, e.g. history tabs) | `registerChannelTab` |
| `ClientPlugin` adding a task to the Channels panel | `simple-channel-history` ("View History") | `registerChannelAction` — adds a right-click item + Channel Tasks button for a single-channel selection |
| `ClientPlugin` adding a task to the Code Templates panel | `simple-channel-history` ("View History") | `registerCodeTemplateAction` — adds a right-click item for a selected code template |
| *(none — Swing's `MessageBrowser` takes no plugin tasks)* | | `registerMessageAction` — adds a right-click item on a message row + a Message Tasks button for the selected row, with the row's connector in context. Web-only; API `4.7`+ |
| `CodeTemplatePlugin` (`getReferenceItems`) | `http` (HTTP Listener/Sender Functions), `file` (File Reader Functions) | `registerReferences(category, items)`: adds entries to the filter/transformer Reference list, in a new category or in an existing one such as `Conversion Functions`, and to script autocomplete. Each entry shows only in its `contexts`. API `4.8`+ |
| `TransformerStepPlugin` / `FilterRulePlugin` | mapper, messagebuilder, javascriptstep, xsltstep, destinationsetfilter, scriptfilestep, iterator; rulebuilder, javascriptrule, scriptfilerule | bundled as the `transformer-steps` web plugin calling `registerStepType` / `registerRuleType` |
| `AttachmentViewer` | `imageviewer`, `pdfviewer`, `dicomviewer`, `textviewer` | each ships as a web plugin (`plugins/attachment-*`) calling `registerAttachmentViewer`; the message browser picks the first whose `canHandle(attachment)` matches |
| `ConnectorSettingsPanel` | every connector (tcp, http, file, …) | each ships as a web plugin (`plugins/connector-*`) calling `registerConnectorPanel`; panels live in the shared connector library (`client/connectors/*.js` + `forms.js`). See `plugins/sqs-connector` in the SQS repo for a third-party one |
| `ConnectorPropertiesPlugin` | `httpauth` (HTTP Authentication), SSL managers | `httpauth` ships as a web plugin (`plugins/httpauth`) calling `registerConnectorPropertiesPanel`; renders as the "Authentication" panel on HTTP Listener sources |
| `DataTypeClientPlugin` | `datatypes/*` (HL7 v2, XML, …) | each ships as a web plugin (`plugins/datatype-*`) calling `registerDataType`; `client/datatypes/index.ts` is the app's registry read-side (`dataTypeDef` / `dataTypeList`), and `props-editor.tsx` renders any registered type |
| `TransmissionModePlugin` | `mllpmode` (MLLP framing) | `registerTransmissionMode` — Basic is built in; `mllpmode` ships as a plugin. TCP's Transmission Mode dropdown + ⚙ settings dialog + Sample Frame are driven by the registry |
| `ResourceClientPlugin` | `directoryresource` (Directory resource type) | `registerResourceType` — the Settings → Resources panel is generic; `directoryresource` ships as a plugin providing the Directory type editor |
| `AuthorizationController` (RBAC menu-hiding) | commercial "Role-Based Access Control" plugin | `setAuthorizationController({ checkTask(taskGroup, taskName) })` — hides nav items, task buttons, and right-click items the user isn't authorized for. Identifiers mirror Swing's `TaskConstants`. **See [`RBAC.md`](RBAC.md)** for the hook, a worked example, and the full permission catalog |

### Bundled web plugins

Like the Swing client, the web administrator does **not** privilege its built-in
features — they ship as plugins under `plugins/`, loaded through the same
mechanism a third-party plugin uses. The core client is a thin shell plus the
shared frameworks they build on (the connector toolkit `client/connectors/forms.js`,
the data-type properties renderer `client/datatypes/props-editor.tsx`, the form
builder, etc.). Current set:

- **Connectors** (`connector-*`): vm, tcp, http, file, database, javascript, smtp, ws, dicom, jms, document
- **Data types** (`datatype-*`): hl7v2, hl7v3, xml, json, raw, delimited, edi, ncpdp, dicom
- **Transformer steps & filter rules** (`transformer-steps`): mapper, messagebuilder, javascriptstep, xsltstep, destinationsetfilter, scriptfilestep, iterator; rulebuilder, javascriptrule, scriptfilerule
- **Dashboard tabs/columns**: `server-log`, `global-maps`, `connection-status`
- **Attachment viewers** (`attachment-*`): imageviewer, pdfviewer, textviewer, dicomviewer
- **Settings panel**: `datapruner`
- **Connector properties**: `httpauth`, `tls-manager`
- **Transmission mode**: `mllpmode` (Basic is built in)
- **Resource type**: `directoryresource`

The shared frameworks stay in `client/` and are imported by bundled plugins via
absolute URL (e.g. `/connectors/forms.js`, `/core/ui.js`) — the web equivalent
of a Swing extension depending on `mirth-client-core`.

Server-side plugin classes (`ServicePlugin`, `ChannelPlugin`,
`DataTypeServerPlugin`, `AuthorizationPlugin`, `ResourcePlugin`, …) run inside
the engine regardless of which administrator you use; when they expose REST
servlets (`apiProvider`), the web admin reaches them at
`/api/extensions/<path>` exactly like the bundled Server Log plugin does.

## Building against the `@oie/*` packages

A plugin reaches the web-admin framework through three published packages:

| Package | What it is | Swing analogue |
|---|---|---|
| [`@oie/web-api`](../packages/web-api) | Engine REST client + model helpers (`api`, `asList`, `uuid`) | `mirth-client-core` server API |
| [`@oie/web-ui`](../packages/web-ui) | DOM toolkit, `DataTable`, dialogs, forms, code editor, columns | the Swing widget toolkit |
| [`@oie/web-shell`](../packages/web-shell) | The `platform` extension points you register through | `ClientPlugin` SPI |

```jsx
import { platform } from '@oie/web-shell';
const React = platform.React;          // share the host's React (see "Writing plugins in React")

function MyView() {
    return <div className="view"><h1>Hello from a plugin</h1></div>;
}

export function register() {
    // Bring your own glyph (or use a built-in name — see core/icons.ts). Path
    // data on a 24x24 grid, rendered stroke-only in currentColor; on shells
    // without the name the icon degrades to the built-in `info` glyph.
    platform.registerIcon('plug', 'M9 7V3M15 7V3M6 7h12v4a6 6 0 0 1-12 0V7zM12 17v4');
    platform.registerNavItem({ id: 'my-plugin', label: 'My Plugin', icon: 'plug',
        path: '/my-plugin', section: 'Engine', order: 99 });
    // reactView() wraps a component as a routed-view handler.
    platform.registerView('/my-plugin', platform.reactView(MyView), { title: 'My Plugin' });
}
```

### API version compatibility

The framework surface — the `platform` registries plus the `@oie/web-*` exports —
is versioned by an **API contract version**, `platform.apiVersion`. Web Administrator
implements **4.8.0** against OIE **4.6.0**. The API minor can advance independently
when exports are added; it is not the application or engine version. It follows
major.minor (the patch is ignored for compatibility): the **minor** bumps when the
surface *grows* (new registry, new export), the **major** bumps on any *breaking*
change (a removed/renamed export or a changed signature).

Your plugin declares the minimum it was built against in `plugin.json`:

```json
"oie": { "apiMin": "4.6" }
```

At load time the web administrator compares that minimum to the `apiVersion` it
implements and **only registers your plugin when it's compatible** — same major,
and its minor ≥ your `apiMin`. This is forward-compatible: a plugin built for `4.6`
keeps working on `4.7`, `4.9`, … (nothing is removed within a major). It's skipped
only when the web administrator is **older** than your `apiMin` (it lacks an API you
use) or a **major** bump dropped something you relied on. A skipped plugin is never
imported — its code never runs — and it shows as **Incompatible** under
**Extensions → Web Administrator Plugins** with the reason, rather than crashing.

Guidance:
- Omit `oie.apiMin` and your plugin always loads (no gate) — fine for plugins built
  and shipped in lockstep with a known web administrator (e.g. the bundled ones).
- Set it to the version that introduced the newest capability you use, so an older
  host degrades gracefully instead of throwing on a missing API. `registerMessageAction`,
  for example, arrived in API `4.7`, so a plugin that calls it declares `"apiMin": "4.7"`.
- `registerReferences` arrived in API `4.8`. A plugin that calls it declares `"apiMin": "4.8"`.
- Settings panel save declarations accept `Promise<boolean>` as well as `boolean`,
  matching the host's existing await behavior. This is a type correction, not an
  API change.
- For runtime feature-detection, read `platform.apiVersion` directly (import
  `OIE_API_VERSION` / `apiCompatible` from `@oie/web-shell` if you need the raw value
  or the comparison helper).

### API 4.8 plugin contracts

The framework implements API **4.8.0**. Plugins using the capabilities
below should declare `"oie": { "apiMin": "4.8" }`.

| Surface | Addition |
|---|---|
| `@oie/web-shell` | `ReferenceItem`, `platform.registerReferences(category, items)` and `platform.references()`; see [Script references](#script-references). |
| `@oie/web-ui` / `platform.createCodeEditor` | `completionScope` selects the active JavaScript completion context; see [Platform services](#platform-services). |
| `@oie/web-ui` connector forms | `FormField.onSet` receives `previousValue`, `RequiredFieldSpec.unset` marks placeholder selections as missing, and React code fields accept `completionScope`; see [Connector form callbacks and validation](#connector-form-callbacks-and-validation). |
| Engine extension manifest | `vocabularies` is consumed by **Web Support 1.1.0**, independently of the browser API gate; see [Datatype vocabulary descriptions](#datatype-vocabulary-descriptions). |

### Two import styles, one runtime instance

There are two ways to pull in the framework, and **both resolve to the same
single shell instance at runtime**:

- **`@oie/*` bare specifiers** — for plugins developed as their own repo/package.
  You get `npm install`, type inference, lint, and bundler support. At runtime
  the page's **import map** rewrites `@oie/web-ui` → `/core/pkg-ui.js` (the
  shell's already-loaded copy).
- **Absolute URLs** (`/core/ui.js`, `/connectors/forms.js`) — the original style,
  resolving against `client/` as the web root. Still fully supported for the
  framework imports.

Either way the plugin's JSX is compiled to `web/plugin.js` first (React comes
from `platform.React`, not an import) — see
[Building the browser entry](#building-the-browser-entry).

The single-instance rule is what makes registrations stick: your
`platform.registerView(...)` must mutate the **shell's** registry. That's why you
must **never deep-import** (`@oie/web-ui/dist/...`) or bundle a second copy of the
framework into your plugin — a duplicate registers into a dead registry and
silently does nothing. The `@oie/eslint-config` rule below flags the static
imports that would do this.

### Lint config

Add [`@oie/eslint-config`](../packages/eslint-config) so the build fails when a
plugin's **static imports** reach past the public API into shell internals
(`client/core`, `client/connectors`, `client/views`, the `/core/*` absolute-URL
form) or a package's deep paths. It's a lint-time guard over `import` statements —
it can't catch a dynamic `import()` of a computed path, so still treat `@oie/*` as
the only entry by convention:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import oie from '@oie/eslint-config';
export default oie;
```

It also enables `no-undef` / `no-unused-vars` — semantic mistakes a syntax-only
`node --check` does not detect.

## Browser side

### Content Security Policy (plugin-API rule)

The app is served with a strict CSP; plugin code runs under it. Two things it
forbids that plugin authors must not rely on:

- **No `eval` / `new Function` / string-argument timers.** `script-src` carries
  no `'unsafe-eval'`. This applies inside Workers too (blob workers inherit the
  page's policy). If you need to check a user-entered script, use the sanctioned
  engine-backed helper — it validates with the engine's own Rhino compiler
  (E4X-aware, i.e. what the script will actually run under):

  ```js
  import { validateScript } from '@oie/web-api';
  const r = await validateScript(code);   // { ok: true } | { ok: false, message } | { ok: null, message: unavailable }
  ```

- **No inline `<script>` tags.** `script-src` allows only same-origin module
  scripts (plus the shell's own nonce'd importmap). Load code as ES modules from
  your plugin directory; never inject script text into the DOM.

Inline **styles** remain allowed (`style-src 'unsafe-inline'`), so React `style`
props and `<style>` injection keep working.

`web/plugin.js` is dynamically imported and must export:

```js
export function register(platform) { ... }
```

> The `platform` argument and the `@oie/web-shell` `platform` export are the same
> object — use whichever reads better. `@oie/*` imports additionally give you
> `api`/`h`/etc. directly, equivalent to `platform.api` / `platform.ui.h`.

### Writing plugins in React

Component-based plugin UI uses **React**, sharing the host app's single React
instance. The rule:

```jsx
import { platform } from '@oie/web-shell';
const React = platform.React;          // the host's React — NOT an `import 'react'`
```

- **Get React from `platform.React`**, at module scope, before any JSX. Do **not**
  `import React from 'react'` or bundle your own copy — a second React instance
  breaks hooks/context and registers into a dead tree. (`platform.React` is set by
  the shell at boot, before any plugin loads.) Once `React` is in scope you write
  ordinary JSX and use `React.useState`/`useEffect`/`useRef`/etc.
- **Component registries hold a `component`.** The host renders it in-tree — you
  never touch a DOM node or `appendChild`. The exceptions are called out below:
  routed views can use an imperative handler, channel tabs retain a legacy
  `render(host, ctx)` form, and dashboard columns use per-cell callbacks that
  return JSX.
- **The descriptor is mostly plain data.** `component(ctx)` is a React function
  component that receives `ctx` as **props** and **returns JSX**; everything else
  on the descriptor (`defaults`, `create`, `canHandle`, `isSupported`,
  `propertiesClass`, transmission `apply`/`sampleFrame`) is plain data/logic.
  Imperative helpers are fine to *call* from handlers —
  `platform.ui.modal/confirmDialog/toast`, `platform.api.*`.
  > `modal()` and `toast()` return `{ close(), el }` handles. `contextMenu()`
  > returns the menu element (or `null` when every item is hidden); it dismisses
  > itself through the host's menu lifecycle. These values are available as soon
  > as the call returns, so you can measure or restyle the rendered element.
- **Styling.** Use **Tailwind v4 utilities** (`bg-bg2`, `text-text-dim`,
  `text-accent`, `border-line`, `flex`, `gap-2`, `mt-[14px]`, …) — generated from
  the design-token CSS variables, so light/dark theming is automatic, no `dark:`
  variants — plus the app's **component classes** (`.btn`/`.btn-primary`,
  `.panel`/`.panel-header`/`.panel-body`, `.dt`, `.field`, `.tag`, `.pip`,
  `.modal`, `.toast`, `.view`, `.mono`, `.hint`, …). For a horizontal radio group
  use `.radio-group.inline-row`. A menu's look is `.ctx-surface`; `.ctx-menu`
  only adds the coordinate placement the DOM menu does for itself, so style
  against `.ctx-surface`.
  > **Separately-built plugins** (compiled in their own repo) can use the
  > component classes and the *common* utilities the host already emits, but the
  > host's Tailwind build only generates utilities it sees in **host** source —
  > so for arbitrary/uncommon ones (e.g. `w-[420px]`) use inline `style` or ship
  > your own Tailwind-generated CSS (scan your source, map the design tokens via
  > `@theme inline`). In-tree plugins (`plugins/**`) are scanned by the host
  > build, so any utility works.

The bundled plugins are the reference implementations — read
`plugins/connection-status/web/plugin.tsx` (a dashboard tab component + column
`cell`/`connectorCell`) and `plugins/global-maps/web/plugin.tsx` (a polled tab
with a JSX table + modal).

### Building the browser entry

The browser loads `web/plugin.js`; you author `web/plugin.tsx` (or `.ts` when no
JSX is needed). Compile JSX to
`React.createElement` with React taken from `platform.React` (so it stays out of
your bundle), keeping `@oie/*` external:

- **First-party** plugins (in this repo's `plugins/`) are built automatically by
  `npm run build` (which runs `tools/build-plugins.mjs`, esbuild). Just write the
  `.ts`/`.tsx`; the `.js` is generated. A plugin's own npm dependencies are **bundled
  into its `web/plugin.js`** (only `@oie/*` stays external) — e.g. the DICOM
  attachment viewer imports `dicom-parser` and ships it inside its bundle; add
  the dep to the repo's `web-administrator/package.json` so the build resolves it.
- **Third-party** plugins ship a **pre-built `web/plugin.js`** in their zip (the
  repo's builder only scans its own `plugins/`). Compile with esbuild (or any
  bundler) using the same settings:

  ```js
  // build.mjs
  import { build } from 'esbuild';
  await build({
      entryPoints: ['web/plugin.tsx'],
      outfile: 'web/plugin.js',
      bundle: true, format: 'esm', target: 'es2022',
      jsx: 'transform', jsxFactory: 'React.createElement', jsxFragment: 'React.Fragment',
      external: ['@oie/web-api', '@oie/web-ui', '@oie/web-shell'],
  });
  ```

> **Connector panels are shared framework code, not plugins.** Their
> `client/connectors/*.{ts,tsx}` sources are compiled with the core framework by
> `tools/build-core.mjs` into checked-in sibling `.js` files, which the
> `connector-*` plugins load by URL. Edit the TypeScript source and run
> `npm run build -w oie-web-administrator`; never edit generated `.js` directly.

### Extension points (Swing equivalents in parentheses)

```jsx
import { platform } from '@oie/web-shell';
const React = platform.React;

// Plugin glyph for the shared icon set: SVG path data on a 24x24 grid, drawn
// stroke-only (1.7px, currentColor, no fill) like every built-in. The name is
// then valid anywhere an `icon` is accepted (nav items, actions, commands,
// ui.icon()). Built-in names can't be overridden; unknown names fall back to
// the `info` glyph, so a plugin on an older shell degrades instead of breaking
// (guard with platform.registerIcon?.(...) if you support pre-registerIcon shells).
platform.registerIcon(name, pathData);

// Full routed view + rail navigation (ClientPlugin)
platform.registerNavItem({ id, label, icon, path, section, order });
platform.registerView('/my-path/:param?',
    platform.reactView(({ params, query }) => <div className="view">…</div>),
    { title: 'My View' });

// Command-palette entry. Supply either `path` or `run`; task/rbac use the same
// RBAC pair as nav and menu items. Returns an unregister function.
const unregisterCommand = platform.registerCommand({
    id: 'my-plugin:open', label: 'Open My Plugin', icon: 'plug',
    section: 'Plugins', path: '/my-path', task: 'doShowMyPlugin', rbac: 'view'
});

// Dashboard tab below the status table (DashboardTabPlugin)
platform.registerDashboardTab({ id, label, order,
    component: ({ selection }) => <div className="dt-wrap">…</div> });

// Extra dashboard column (DashboardColumnPlugin) — cell/connectorCell RETURN JSX
// (per-row, so not a single component).
platform.registerDashboardColumn({ id, label, order,
    cell: (status) => <span>…</span>,            // channel row
    connectorCell: (child) => <span>…</span> });  // connector child row

// Tab inside the channel editor (ChannelTabPlugin)
platform.registerChannelTab({ id, label, order,
    component: ({ channel, onChange }) => <div>…</div> });

// Tab in Settings (SettingsPanelPlugin). The component declares its task pane by
// calling ctx.setTasks(title, items) (from an effect) — same callback as before.
platform.registerSettingsPanel({ id, label, order,
    component: ({ platform, setTasks }) => <div className="view">…</div> });

// Per-channel action (a Swing ClientPlugin adding a task to the Channels panel):
// shows in the channel right-click menu AND the Channel Tasks pane for a single
// selected channel. onInvoke gets the full channel; ctx = { platform, channel,
// selectedIds }. isEnabled(ctx) defaults to "exactly one channel selected".

### Platform services

| API | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `platform.apiVersion` | The `@oie/*` API contract version this web administrator implements — is `"4.8.0"`, independently of the engine version. Read it for runtime feature-detection; declare your minimum via `oie.apiMin` in `plugin.json`. See [API version compatibility](#api-version-compatibility). |
| `platform.React` | The host's React instance — `const React = platform.React` at module scope, then write JSX. Sharing it is mandatory (one instance app-wide); never `import 'react'`. |
| `platform.reactView(Component)` | Wraps a React component as a routed-view handler for `registerView(path, platform.reactView(Component), { title })`. The component gets `{ params, query }` props. |
| `platform.api` | Full engine REST client (`api.channels`, `api.messages`, `api.status`, … plus raw `api.get/post/put/del`). All calls share the user's session. |
| `platform.api.channels.tags(channelId)` / `platform.api.server.channelTags()` | Assigned tags for one channel / all server tags, with names preserved as exact XML text. See [Channel tag helpers](#channel-tag-helpers). |
| `platform.ui` | DOM toolkit: `h()`, `DataTable`, `tabs()`, `modal()`, `confirmDialog`, `promptDialog`, `toast`, `contextMenu`, form helpers, `downloadFile`, `pickFile`, `fmtDate`, `icon(name)`. `fmtDate` renders every timestamp in the user's chosen time zone (the topbar Server/Local/UTC toggle, `core/timezone.js`) — use it for all displayed dates. |
| `platform.setAuthorizationController(ctrl)` / `platform.checkTask(group, task)` | RBAC menu-hiding (Swing `AuthorizationController`). A plugin registers `{ checkTask(taskGroup, taskName) }` to hide nav/task/right-click items; `checkTask` is what the menu builders consult. Default allows all. **See [`RBAC.md`](RBAC.md).** |
| `platform.columns` | Resizable + reorderable columns for hand-built `table.dt` grids: `createColumnManager(key, defaultWidths)` + `decorateColumns(table, opts)`. See [Resizable / reorderable columns](#resizable--reorderable-columns). |
| `platform.oie` | Model helpers: `elementsToArray`/`arrayToElements` (XStream polymorphic lists), `newChannel`, `statePip`, `uuid`. Data types are exposed separately through `platform.dataTypes()`. |
| `platform.dataTypes()` / `platform.transmissionModes()` / `platform.resourceTypes()` / `platform.attachmentViewers()` | Read the registered data types / transmission modes / resource types / attachment viewers (each populated by a plugin). |
| `platform.registerReferences(category, items)` / `platform.references()` | Add Reference/autocomplete entries and inspect plugin registrations (API `4.8`+). See [Script references](#script-references). |
| `platform.createCodeEditor({ value, language, readOnly, minHeight, onChange, completionScope })` | Code editor component — upgrades to Monaco when reachable (Rhino-tuned User API IntelliSense, in-scope code-template completions, engine-backed validation, and client-side Format Document), else a plain textarea. `completionScope: { channelId, context }` gives the editor its own ContextType: while it has focus, code-template and Reference completions use that context (API `4.8`+). `platform.setCodeEditorFactory` swaps the implementation app-wide. |
| `platform.createDiffEditor({ original, modified, language, renderSideBySide })` | Read-only side-by-side diff viewer backed by the host's single Monaco instance (side-by-side + inline word-level highlighting + syntax colors). Returns `{ el, setModels({ original, modified, language }), layout(), dispose() }`; mount `el`, call `setModels` to swap content, `dispose()` when done. Degrades to a plain two-pane text view if Monaco is unavailable, so you never branch on its presence. Used by `simple-channel-history` for its revision diff. |
| `platform.router` | `navigate(path)`, `currentPath()` |
| `platform.store` / `platform.events` | Shared state (`getState('user')`, `'serverVersion'`, `'webPlugins'`, `'webadminConfig'`) and pub/sub bus |
| `platform.registerLoginAuthenticator(clientPluginClass, authenticate)` | Register a multi-factor / extended-login handler (Swing `MultiFactorAuthenticationClientPlugin`). See [MFA / extended login](#mfa--extended-login) — MUST be registered pre-login, so it only works from a **bundled** plugin. |
| Registry lookups (`navItems()`, `dashboardTabs()`, `channelTabs()`, `stepType()` / `stepTypes()`, `connectorPanel()` / `connectorPanels()`, and their peers) | Read the current public registries. Prefer the singular lookup when you know an id/type; collection accessors return the currently registered values for plugin-to-plugin integration. |

### Channel tag helpers

Both helpers return `Promise<ChannelTag[]>` through the shared engine session:

| Helper | Read and permission |
|---|---|
| `api.channels.tags(channelId: string)` | Reads the assigned tags from that channel's XML export (`GET /channels/{id}`); uses the engine's Channel View permission. |
| `api.server.channelTags()` | Reads all server tags from XML (`GET /server/channelTags`); uses the engine's Tags View permission. |

```ts
import api, { asList } from '@oie/web-api';

export async function assignedTags(channelId: string) {
    const tags = await api.channels.tags(channelId);
    return tags.map(tag => ({ id: tag.id, name: tag.name,
        channelIds: asList(tag.channelIds, 'string') }));
}
```

Names such as `-0`, `null`, `1e5` and long digit strings remain exact strings.
Match existing tags by `id` and preserve their names, memberships and optional
`backgroundColor` when writing. `channelIds` retains its XStream list shape;
use `asList(tag.channelIds, 'string')` as above.

An empty valid tag collection returns `[]`. HTTP/authentication failures,
malformed XML, missing or duplicate identities, missing names, and a mismatched
channel export reject the promise. Keep the draft available for retry; a failed
lookup must not be treated as an empty tag collection. The channel helper is
useful when a user can view a channel but cannot list all server tags.

### Script references

`platform.registerReferences(category: string, items: ReferenceItem[]): void`
adds entries to a new or existing Reference category. Import the `ReferenceItem`
type from `@oie/web-shell` when authoring in TypeScript.

| `ReferenceItem` field | Contract |
|---|---|
| `name`, `code` | Required display name and insertion text or function definition. |
| `description` | Optional documentation shown by the Reference list and autocomplete. |
| `type` | `DRAG_AND_DROP_CODE` (default) inserts the code; `FUNCTION` derives a call from a `function name(args) { ... }` definition; `COMPILED_CODE` is not draggable. |
| `contexts` | Optional array of engine `ContextType` names, such as `SOURCE_FILTER_TRANSFORMER`, `DESTINATION_RESPONSE_TRANSFORMER`, `CHANNEL_DEPLOY` or `SOURCE_RECEIVER`. Omit for every context; an empty array matches none. |

Register once from the plugin's `register()` function: registrations append,
with no replacement or unregister operation. Reference registration supplies
editor hints and insertion text; executable helpers still need to exist in the
engine extension or the channel's linked code-template libraries.

`platform.references(): Array<ReferenceItem & { category: string }>` returns
plugin registrations across all contexts, without the built-in catalog or
channel code templates. It returns a new array; treat its entry objects as
read-only. The host filters entries for the active editor's context.

### Connector form callbacks and validation

The `FormField` and `RequiredFieldSpec` types and `requireFields` helper are
exported by `@oie/web-ui`.

- `FormField.onSet(properties, value, previousValue?)` runs after the field's
  property has been assigned and before the form's `onChange` notification.
  `previousValue` is the value captured when that row was rendered. Both
  `ConnectorForm` and `buildForm` pass it; existing two-argument callbacks work.
- `RequiredFieldSpec.unset?: string` gives `requireFields(properties, specs)`
  an exact placeholder value to reject alongside null, undefined and blank
  values. `key` is a dotted property path, `label` names the missing field, and
  optional `when(properties)` gates the requirement. The result is an array of
  `{ key, label }` errors suitable for a connector's `validate` callback.
- React `ConnectorForm` fields with `type: 'code'` forward
  `completionScope: { channelId, context }` to their shared editor. This applies
  the [editor scope contract](#platform-services) to connector scripts.

```ts
import { requireFields } from '@oie/web-ui';

export function validate(properties: { driver?: string }) {
    return requireFields(properties, [
        { key: 'driver', label: 'Driver', unset: 'Please Select a Driver' }
    ]);
}
```

### MFA / extended login

When a primary login returns a non-success **`ExtendedLoginStatus`** — a status
naming a `clientPluginClass` — the shell hands off to the authenticator registered
for that class string.

**Most MFA plugins need NO web code.** The host ships a built-in generic OTP
authenticator: a server-side plugin (TOTP/HOTP/one-time-code) that returns the
well-known `clientPluginClass` **`builtin:otp`** gets the standard enroll/verify UI
for free — install the engine plugin and it works, nothing to bundle or rebuild.
Its `ExtendedLoginStatus` `message` is a JSON string in the generic OTP protocol:

```jsonc
// already enrolled — ask for a code:
{ "mode": "verify", "challenge": "<opaque, server-signed>", "prompt"?: "<text>" }
// first login — set up + confirm a code (delivered as a login step):
{ "mode": "enroll", "challenge": "<opaque>", "secret": "<base32>",
  "otpauthUri"?: "<uri>", "prompt"?: "<text>" }
```

The client returns the code on the second leg as the login-data header
`base64({ "challenge": "<opaque>", "code": "<digits>" })`; the server signs and
verifies `challenge` (it is opaque to the client). See
[`oie-totp-plugin`](https://github.com/gibson9583/oie-totp-plugin) for a complete
server-only reference.

A method that can't use the generic OTP UI (WebAuthn, push) bundles its OWN
authenticator and registers it against the `clientPluginClass` its server returns:

```js
import { registerLoginAuthenticator } from '../core/login-auth.js';

registerLoginAuthenticator(
    'com.acme.mirth.totp.TotpAuthenticationClientPlugin',   // the server's clientPluginClass
    async (ctx) => {
        // ctx.username      updatedUsername from the primary status, else what was typed
        // ctx.primaryStatus the full parsed primary result { status, message, ... }
        // ctx.api           the full engine client (Swing hands the plugin `client`)
        // ctx.submit(data)  performs the SECOND-leg login carrying `data` in the
        //                   X-Mirth-Login-Data header; resolves to the parsed status
        const code = await promptForCode();                 // your own modal
        if (code == null) return { status: 'FAIL', message: 'Cancelled.' };
        return ctx.submit(code);                             // returns the engine's status
    });
```

The flow mirrors Swing exactly: primary login → `ExtendedLoginStatus(clientPluginClass)`
→ run the authenticator → its second-leg login (with the factor in the
`X-Mirth-Login-Data` header) → the engine delegates to its server-side MFA plugin →
`SUCCESS`.

**A custom authenticator must be bundled.** MFA runs before a session exists, but
engine-served plugins load *after* login (fetched with the session). So a custom
(non-`builtin:otp`) authenticator has to be **bundled** and registered at app boot —
add it to `client/react/login-authenticators.ts`, the single pre-login registration
point. (Server-only OTP plugins avoid this entirely via `builtin:otp` above.)
This matches Swing, whose MFA plugin ships in the client, not the server; an
engine-*installed* plugin cannot provide MFA (it can't be fetched without the auth
it grants). If an engine requires an MFA class no bundled authenticator handles, the
login screen says so instead of failing opaquely.

### Resizable / reorderable columns

`platform.columns` (core module `core/columns.js`) makes any **imperatively
built** `table.dt` grid's columns drag-to-reorder, drag-to-resize, and
double-click-to-auto-fit, with the order and widths persisted per table in
`localStorage`.

> In a React plugin, render a plain JSX `<table className="dt">` for most tables.
> To add the resizable/reorderable affordances on top, mount the decorator from a
> ref: `const ref = React.useRef(); React.useEffect(() => decorateColumns(ref.current, …), [])`
> and put the `ref` on the `<table>`. (The host's own grids use the React
> `<TreeTable>` component instead — it bakes these affordances in — but that's
> internal and not exposed to plugins.) The imperative recipe below is for the
> absolute-URL / non-React authoring style.

Build your header/body rows in a **fixed canonical column order**, then call
`decorateColumns` after the table is in the DOM — it switches the table to fixed
layout with a `<colgroup>`, permutes each row's cells into the saved order, draws
the affordances, and leaves the **last column auto-width** so it fills the
container.

```js
const colMgr = platform.columns.createColumnManager('my-table', {
    id: 80, name: 240, info: 200          // default widths per data-column key
});

function render() {
    const table = h('table.dt',
        h('thead', h('tr', h('th', 'Id'), h('th', 'Name'), h('th', 'Info'))),
        h('tbody', rows.map(r => h('tr', h('td', r.id), h('td', r.name), h('td', r.info)))));
    host.appendChild(table);
    platform.columns.decorateColumns(table, {
        manager: colMgr,
        presentKeys: ['id', 'name', 'info'],   // canonical order of the data columns
        pinned: 0,                              // # of leading fixed columns (e.g. an expand twisty)
        pinnedWidths: [],                       // widths for those pinned columns
        onChange: render                        // re-render after a reorder
    });
}
```

Notes:
- Every rendered row (header + body) must have the same cell count: `pinned`
  leading cells then one cell per `presentKeys` entry, in canonical order. Rows
  with a different shape (e.g. a `colSpan` empty-state row) are skipped.
- For live-updating tables, rebuild the whole table (thead + tbody) each refresh
  and call `decorateColumns` again — don't decorate a header twice (it would
  double-permute).
- Cells clip (`overflow: hidden` / ellipsis) so a narrowed column never grows the
  row height. Keep flex cell content on a single line (`flex-wrap: nowrap`).

### Rules of the road

1. **Round-trip engine objects.** GET → mutate → PUT the same object. Never
   delete `@class`/`@version` keys or fields you don't understand — they belong
   to the engine model or to server-side plugins.
2. Engine lists may arrive as a bare object when they have one element — use
   `platform.api.asList(value, key)`. To *show* an XStream-encoded value (a map or
   list a script stored in the global map, a `Response`), render it with
   `toDisplayString` from `@oie/web-api`: it prints what the Swing client prints —
   `{k=v, …}` for any map, `[a, b]` for a list — instead of the encoding's
   `entry`/`string` structure, and descends class-named wrappers (a `MapBuilder`
   from `Maps.map()`) to the map inside.
3. Style with Tailwind utilities + the app's component classes (see *Writing
   plugins in React* above) so plugins match both themes — noting the
   separately-built-plugin caveat (only host-emitted utilities are available
   unless the plugin ships its own CSS).
4. **Gate your background polls.** A `setInterval`/`setTimeout` loop at module
   scope outlives your view — and the session. Before every fetch, check that
   a session exists and that your view is actually on screen, and re-arm
   without fetching otherwise:

   ```js
   async function poll() {
       // no session (logged out) → engine calls would 401 every tick, and
       // any poll traffic resets the engine's session-inactivity timeout
       if (!platform.store.getState('user')) return arm();
       // not on the view this data feeds → wasted engine calls
       const path = platform.router.currentPath();
       if (!path.startsWith('/dashboard')) return arm();
       // ...fetch + render, then arm()
   }
   ```

   Keeping module-scope *state* (so monitoring survives a tab re-mount and
   resumes when the user returns) is fine — it's the ungated *fetch* that
   causes trouble. Beware `'/'`: it is only ever the logged-out path (the
   shell rewrites it to `/dashboard` in-session), so never whitelist it.
   Polls inside a component with proper `useEffect` cleanup (fetch loop dies
   on unmount, like the server-log tab) don't need the route check — only
   the session check if any timer survives the view.

## Server side

`server.js` (CommonJS) lets a plugin add endpoints on the **web administrator's
own Node server** — *no engine (Java) extension required*. This is the piece that
makes a **pure-JavaScript plugin** possible: a React frontend plus a `server.js`
backend, fully self-contained. Before this, any server-side behaviour had to be
written and deployed as a Java engine extension; now a plugin can own its
backend in Node:

```js
module.exports = function register(router, { config, manifest, log }) {
    router.get('/status', (req, res) => res.json({ ok: true }));
};
```

The router mounts at `/plugin-api/<id>/`. Use it for things the browser can't
do directly (filesystem, other backends, secrets). Requests to `/api/...` are
proxied to the engine and carry the browser's engine session; `/plugin-api`
endpoints are **not** authenticated by the engine and are reachable before
login. The engine session cookie is scoped to `/api`, so it is not an automatic
credential for these routes. Design and enforce your own authentication and
authorization before exposing anything sensitive.

> **`server.js` runs arbitrary Node in the web admin process** (it can read this
> host's filesystem and config). Only install plugins from trusted sources — see
> the "Install only trusted plugins" note above. For most needs prefer an engine
> extension's REST servlet (reachable at `/api/extensions/<path>`, the way the
> bundled `server-log` plugin works), which runs in the engine with its auth.

## Adding UI for custom engine connectors

Engine-side plugins can add entirely new connector types (a `source.xml` /
`destination.xml` descriptor plus a shared `ConnectorProperties` class). The
channel editor's Connector Type select lists every type the engine reports
(`GET /extensions/connectors`), but types without a web panel are labeled
"(no web editor)" and cannot be *selected* — the web administrator can't
invent the engine's `@class` properties object. Existing channels that
already use such a type still render through the generic JSON fallback panel.
To make a custom connector fully editable, ship a companion web admin plugin
that registers a connector panel.

> **A connector's web half is only a property panel.** The connector itself
> (e.g. the AWS SQS transport) is an *engine* extension — Java that runs in the
> engine regardless of which administrator you use. The web plugin just renders
> the settings form. That's why its toolkit lives in `@oie/web-ui` (the form
> builder and connector-panel helpers), not in any "connectors" package.

The SQS connector is the worked example. Its panel takes React from
`platform.React` and imports the form helpers from `@oie/web-ui`; the host page's
import map resolves that to the shell's loaded copy at runtime, so **React and the
framework stay out of the plugin's bundle** — only the panel's own JSX is compiled
to `web/plugin.js`, which ships inside the engine extension zip:

```jsx
// sqs-source-connector .../webadmin/web/plugin.tsx (abridged) — compiled to plugin.js
import { platform } from '@oie/web-shell';
import { ConnectorForm, PollSection, defaultPollProperties, defaultSourceProperties } from '@oie/web-ui';
const React = platform.React;

const awsFields = () => [ /* schema-driven field defs: queueUrl, region, authType, … */ ];

const sqsReader = {
    defaults(version) {
        return {
            // FQCN of the engine plugin's shared properties class
            '@class': 'com.mirth.connect.connectors.sqs.SqsReceiverProperties',
            '@version': version,
            pluginProperties: null,

### Shipping the web UI inside the engine extension

An engine extension carries its web admin plugin in a `webadmin/` folder inside
the extension zip (`<extension>/webadmin/plugin.json` + compiled assets).

**Install through the UI** (one action): **Extensions → Install Extension**
uploads the zip to the *web administrator*, which forwards it to the engine's
installer (the engine enforces `EXTENSIONS_MANAGE`). The **engine** installs the
extension. An engine with native web-support endpoints serves its `webadmin/`
half at `/api/webplugins/<extensionPath>/…`; otherwise the Web Support
extension serves it at
`/api/extensions/websupport/webplugins/<extensionPath>/…`. **Restart the
engine**; on the next browser load the web administrator probes the native path
first, then the Web Support fallback, and loads the plugin. The web admin keeps
**no local copy** — a
plugin's UI follows the engine it's installed on (so it appears only where its
extension is installed, and stays version-matched to that engine).

Uninstalling the extension (which the engine owns) removes its UI too — nothing
is stored web-admin-side. The web administrator's own bundled framework plugins
(under `./plugins`) still load locally; only engine-paired plugins are
engine-served. Declare the API version your plugin needs with `oie.apiMin` (see
[API version compatibility](#api-version-compatibility)) so an older web
administrator skips it cleanly instead of crashing.

**Building the webadmin half in Maven.** Since `web/plugin.js` is now a compiled
artifact (from `web/plugin.tsx`), build it before packaging. Either commit the
built `web/plugin.js` (your `maven-resources` copy picks it up), or wire
`frontend-maven-plugin` to build it during `mvn package` (runs in
`generate-resources`, before the `webadmin/` copy) — and exclude the build
tooling from the copied resources:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.github.eirslett</groupId>
  <artifactId>frontend-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.15.1</version>
  <configuration><workingDirectory>webadmin</workingDirectory>
    <installDirectory>${project.build.directory}</installDirectory></configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution><id>install-node-and-npm</id><phase>generate-resources</phase>
      <goals><goal>install-node-and-npm</goal></goals>
      <configuration><nodeVersion>v22.18.0</nodeVersion></configuration></execution>
    <execution><id>npm-install</id><phase>generate-resources</phase>
      <goals><goal>npm</goal></goals><configuration><arguments>install</arguments></configuration></execution>
    <execution><id>npm-build-webadmin</id><phase>generate-resources</phase>
      <goals><goal>npm</goal></goals><configuration><arguments>run build</arguments></configuration></execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
<!-- on the webadmin copy-resources <resource>, exclude: node_modules/**,
     package.json, package-lock.json, web/build.mjs, web/plugin.tsx -->
```

Three things must line up with the engine plugin:

1. **Transport name** — the first argument to `registerConnectorPanel` must
   equal the `<name>` in the engine descriptor (`source.xml`/`destination.xml`),
   which is also what `ConnectorProperties.getName()` returns and what the
   channel stores in `connector.transportName` (`"SQS Reader"` above).
2. **`defaults(version)` must mirror the Java properties class** — same
   `@class` (the `sharedClassName` FQCN), every field the Java constructor
   initializes with the same default values, and the built-in sub-objects
   (`sourceConnectorProperties` / `pollConnectorProperties` /
   `destinationConnectorProperties`) when the Java class implements the
   corresponding interface. The connector-panel helpers in `@oie/web-ui`
   (`defaultSourceProperties`, `defaultPollProperties`,
   `defaultDestinationProperties`) produce those shapes.
3. **Take React from `platform.React` and the framework from `@oie/web-ui`** —
   the host page's import map resolves `@oie/*` to the shell's loaded copy at
   runtime, so React and the framework are **never bundled** into the plugin. The
   plugin's own JSX **does** need compiling to `web/plugin.js` (the served entry)
   — ship that pre-built `.js` in the zip (see
   [Building the browser entry](#building-the-browser-entry)).

The web panel registration alone makes the type selectable; if the engine
plugin isn't installed, saving/deploying a channel that uses it will fail on
the engine side.

## Datatype vocabulary descriptions

Web Support **1.1.0** can load an extension's message vocabulary on the engine
and return field names with the existing serialization response. Add a
`vocabularies` map to the extension's existing `webadmin/plugin.json`, keeping
its other fields:

```json
{
    "id": "datatype-edifact",
    "vocabularies": {
        "EDIFACT": "com.mirth.connect.plugins.datatypes.edifact.EDIFACTVocabulary"
    }
}
```

The key must match the installed datatype's plugin point name. The class must
extend `com.mirth.connect.model.util.MessageVocabulary`, be available in the
engine extension's **SHARED** libraries, expose a public
`(String version, String type)` constructor and return the matching datatype
from `getDataType()`. Constructor arguments come from each message's serializer
metadata; the server does not instantiate a Swing client plugin.

`POST /api/extensions/websupport/datatypes/_serialize?dataType=EDIFACT` accepts
the message as `text/plain` and returns
`{ format, data, meta: { root, descriptions } }`. Optional `props` is a query
parameter containing newline-separated `key=value` serialization overrides.
For XML output, `descriptions` maps element IDs to vocabulary names; the client
uses these in message trees. This keeps the existing REST
response shape and does not introduce a new browser API version.

Only engine-enabled extensions participate; `"enabled": false` in the manifest
also excludes its vocabulary. Built-in HL7 v2, X12, NCPDP and DICOM mappings
remain authoritative. Missing, invalid, unavailable or conflicting declarations
fall back to bare labels without preventing serialization. Manifests are read
per request and vocabulary instances are not shared; updated SHARED libraries
still require an engine restart.

## Pairing with engine-side extensions

An engine plugin that registers its own REST servlet (via `apiProviders` in its
`plugin.xml`) is reachable from the browser at `/api/extensions/<path>` —
exactly how the bundled `server-log` plugin reads
`GET /api/extensions/serverlog`. Ship the engine half as a normal engine
extension and the UI half as a web admin plugin with the same name.
