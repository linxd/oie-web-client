/*
 * React entry point. Replaces app.js as the bundle entry (index.html). Mounts
 * the React <App> (auth gate → shell) into #app; the shell drives the existing
 * core/router.js and mounts the still-vanilla views during the migration.
 *
 * The shell root is wrapped in QueryClientProvider. Individual
 * views mount in their OWN React roots via react/mount.jsx, which wrap with the
 * same shared `queryClient` — so the server-state cache is shared app-wide.

// the outlet every view mounts into, so a throw here really does leave an empty
// page — the one case where a full-page report is the right fallback. The dialog,
// toast and context-menu hosts sit outside it deliberately: they are what the
// fallback would need in order to say anything, and a boundary around them could
// not render its own report.
